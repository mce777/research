### Chapter 2 - Selection Sort
- data structures
  - arrays
    - reading is O(1), insertion is O(n)
    - great at reading
  - linked lists
    - insertion is O(1), reading is O(n)
    - not contiguous, optimal for insertion
  - hybrid data structure
    - an array of linked lists
- selection sort
  - example: artist and # of plays, every element looked at, n times
    - so O(n) * n times = O(nÂ²)
  - useful but resource intensive
